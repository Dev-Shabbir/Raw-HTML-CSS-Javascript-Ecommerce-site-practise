Hello there,
This is a simple ecommerce website template which is made with only HTML5, CSS3 and javascript. I only used bootstrap carousel for saving time. I've made the site in 10 hours of my work. I't was a good pactise after a long time with Vanilla js.
The site is not responsive yet. But view width of 1200px or higher is suitable for presenting the site.
And also I've not wrote the code comments. I'll update it very soon.
In the update -
->The site will be responsive.
-> It will have a powerfull backend with nodejs. (Currently it is in server side rendering mode)
-> I'll write detailed code comment with the explaination of my codes for the motivated one.

After all,
I've learnt some amazing thing doing the project. I put myself under a pressure and successfully did it with a immance experience.
And I'll also share what I've learnt doing this project.
Those who are lerner Stay tuned.
Shabbir.

Thank you.
